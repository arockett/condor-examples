# README File for condor_matlab example

This example shows how to run a matlab process on the htcondor system.
Describe what the matlab program does.

-> Start by looking at the "matlab_job.condor" file

This file is the script that submits the matlab program to the htcondor 
system. Notice how the executable passed to htcondor is a windows batch file.

-> Now look at the windows batch file called "-------.bat" 

The sole purpose of "----.bat" is to execute the ImageJ program from a windows
command line. Since htcondor runs primarily on 
windows machines, and since condor submission scripts submit an executable file
to these machines, an easy way to pass processes to the system is through windows 
batch files.

-> Submit "matlab_job.condor"

condor_submit matlab_job.condor

-> Check that "matlab_job.condor" has finished running on htcondor

The command  $condor_q  will check the queue and display recent and running
jobs on the condor system. Once matlab_job.condor has finished running it should
describe what happens and also create three files in the "output"
directory named "0.err", "0.log", and "0.out".
